These are my solutions for the Advent of Code 2017 coding challenges. Went
with C++ because I wanted to get the feel for it again after years of not
using it at all!

## Setup ##

I personally used g++ to compile my programs. It's rather straightforward
but you can use whichever C++ compiler you please as long as it uses at least
C++11 as I used some of its features in parts of my code.

    $ g++ 1a.cpp -o ../bin/1a -g -Wall -std=c++11; ./../bin/1a

For debugging at certain points I used Valgrind. Specifically for memory
debugging. As such the extra *-g* flag was added to g++.

## License ##

There's no license. This is just for fun and learning so take from it what you
want as you please. Keep in mind this was done as a learning exercise for
getting back into a bit of C++. In that sense the solutions may and quite
probably are not optimal. Either way, Merry Christmas!
